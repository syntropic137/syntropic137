# Review the plan

A different model researched and planned this. Your value is disagreement, not
agreement. You have:

- `artifacts/input/research.md` - the investigation
- `artifacts/input/plan.md` - the proposed approach

> **Where to find that input.** The durable location is the directory
> `artifacts/input/<phase-id>/`, holding whatever the previous phase wrote under
> `artifacts/output/`. A flat `artifacts/input/<phase-id>.md` alias also exists
> today, but `ArtifactCollector` marks it "kept for one release (issue #988)", so
> a prompt that reads only the flat path will silently receive nothing once it
> goes. Look in the directory first and fall back to the flat file. If neither
> exists, stop and say so rather than proceeding on no input.

## The problem as stated

$ARGUMENTS

## Verify against the repository, not against the prose

1. **Are the `file:line` citations real, and do they say what is claimed?**
   A plan citing code that does not exist, or that does something else, is
   worse than a vague one - it looks verified.
2. **Would the approach actually work?** Name the specific place it breaks: a
   call site it missed, an interface that does not exist, an assumption the
   code contradicts.
3. **Is any of this already solved?** Existing helpers, constants or tests the
   plan proposes to rebuild.
4. **Does the verification plan actually verify?** Name any test that would
   still pass with the change reverted.
5. **What did it not consider?** Missing scope, not style you dislike.

## Write to `artifacts/output/review.md`

Separate **BLOCKERS** (the plan fails if unaddressed) from **IMPROVEMENTS**.

## Citing code

Every `file:line` reference MUST be the path from the repository root, exactly
as `git ls-files` prints it - for example
`packages/syn-domain/src/syn_domain/contexts/orchestration/_shared/value_objects.py:85`,
never `_shared/value_objects.py:85`.

An abbreviated path is not a smaller version of a citation, it is an unusable
one. `_shared/value_objects.py` matches four bounded contexts in this
repository and identifies none of them, so a reader cannot follow it and a
checker cannot verify it. Measured across three runs: every cited file was
real, and up to 100% of citations were unusable purely because of this.

## Rules

- Read-only. Modify nothing. Implement nothing.
- Cite `file:line` for every claim. You are holding the plan to that standard.
- If the plan is sound, say so plainly. Do not manufacture findings to look
  thorough - a review that always finds something teaches people to ignore it.

## Judge the design, not only the correctness

A change can be correct and still be the wrong change. Review for what it costs
the next reader, because that is what this project is actually trying to
minimise.

- **Shallow modules.** Does a new class, helper or wrapper hide anything, or
  does it only add a name? A unit whose interface is as complicated as its
  implementation has paid a cost and bought nothing (Ousterhout, *A Philosophy
  of Software Design*).
- **Leaked decisions.** Would changing the implementation force callers to
  change? Then the boundary is wrong, however clean the code looks.
- **Special cases.** Was a branch added to satisfy one caller? Ask whether the
  case could have been made not to exist. Branches are permanent taxes on
  everyone who reads the function afterwards.
- **Duplication of judgement.** Two places that must agree and are not
  mechanically forced to agree WILL drift. This repository has been bitten by
  exactly that: an enum declaring the current tool name while the parser
  hardcoded the old one, and neither was wrong on its own.

Say so plainly when a change is correct but will be expensive to live with.
That is a legitimate finding, not a nitpick - though mark it clearly as a
design concern rather than a blocker, so the author can weigh it.

## Assume the work may be dressed up

Agents under pressure to finish produce work that LOOKS complete: tests that
assert what is already true, a narrower fix that leaves the real defect, a
report stating a number nobody measured. This is not hypothetical - in this
repository a canary built to detect silent drops silently passed on the very
fields its own docstring claimed to check, and a report claimed 34 tests where
there were 26.

So verify the claim against the artifact, not the prose:

- If the report says a test was added, read it. Would it fail if the fix were
  reverted? If you cannot tell, revert the fix and run it.
- If it cites a file and line, open them.
- If it states a count or a timing, run the command and compare.
- If it says a gate passed, check that the gate actually ran.

A right conclusion resting on invented evidence is more dangerous than an
honest gap, because it looks finished.
